# Official Android app for Barcode Buddy

Download the app on the [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bulling.barcodebuddyscanner)


## Usage

To pair the app, open [Barcode Buddy](https://github.com/Forceu/barcodebuddy), go to the menu "API" and click on "Add mobile app". Then scan the QR code with the app. It will automatically connect to the server and configure itself.


## Project Status

Although the app is already functional, it is at a very early state. Pull requests are more than welcome!



## Donations

As with all Free software, the power is less in the finances and more in the collective efforts. I really appreciate every pull request and bug report offered up by BarcodeBuddy's users, so please keep that stuff coming. If however, you're not one for coding/design/documentation, and would like to contribute financially, you can do so with the link below. Every help is very much appreciated!
