# Official Android app for Barcode Buddy

Once it is reviewed, you can download the app through the [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bulling.barcodebuddyscanner)


## Usage

Make sure to use the latest release (at the moment you need to use latest master commit, otherwise the app will not work). Then open Barcode Buddy, go to the menu API and click on the three dots in the top right corner. Select "Add mobile app" and scan the QR code with the app.


## Project Status

Although the app is already functional, it is at a very early state. Pull requests are more than welcome!
